# Overview  
[Provide a high-level overview of your product here. Explain what problem it solves, who it's for, and why it's valuable.]

# Core Features  
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
- ReFlexHire is a next-generation recruitment platform that redefines the value of hiring fees. Instead of charging traditional commission rates, we offer a flat 10% placement fee regardless of the candidate’s salary. But more importantly, we turn that fee into tangible value for your team by providing customizable onboarding and employee care packages. Upon a successful hire, ReFlexHire allocates a portion of the placement fee to deliver welcome experiences such as coffee trucks, curated welcome kits, digital gifts, celebration items, and more—tailored to the new hire's role and salary range. Companies can choose from pre-designed packages or customize their own onboarding services using our exclusive partner mall. This B2B welfare platform not only adds a human touch to hiring but also strengthens employer branding from day one. By turning recruiting expenses into meaningful onboarding experiences, ReFlexHire bridges the gap between hiring and employee retention. Our platform is built to scale, with a modular architecture that allows for future expansion into hiring SaaS, performance tracking tools, or even our “ReFlex OnTheGo” mobile interview experience—an optional service to enhance candidate engagement during the interview stage.
- Traditional recruitment fees often feel like a sunk cost—paid once and quickly forgotten. But what if that same cost could leave a lasting impression on both the company and the new hire? ReFlexHire transforms recruitment from a transactional expense into a strategic opportunity for employer branding and employee engagement. In an era where talent retention is just as critical as hiring, how a company welcomes its people matters more than ever. By reinvesting hiring fees into personalized onboarding experiences, companies can create a strong first impression, increase new hire satisfaction, and foster a sense of belonging from day one. This approach not only boosts internal morale but also differentiates companies in a competitive talent market. ReFlexHire helps growing businesses—especially startups and mid-sized companies—offer onboarding experiences that rival those of large enterprises, without additional budget or HR overhead. It’s not just about hiring the right person; it’s about keeping them.
- ReFlexHire connects great talent with growing companies—then turns hiring fees into onboarding impact.
  1. Recruitment Made Simple : Companies hire candidates through ReFlexHire’s vetted recruiter network at a competitive flat fee rate.
  2. Fee Becomes a Benefit : Instead of charging a one-time fee and ending there, ReFlexHire converts a portion of the fee into onboarding credits—automatically applied to the new hire’s welcome experience.
  3. Customizable Onboarding Store : Clients access a curated marketplace of onboarding services and welcome kits—ranging from personalized gift boxes to team lunch setups, IT gear, or branded swag.
  4. Lasting First Impressions : Companies choose what fits their culture. ReFlexHire takes care of delivery, vendor coordination, and timing—ensuring the new hire feels appreciated from day one.]

# User Experience  
[Describe the user journey and experience. Include:
- User Personas
  1. Startup HR Manager – “Jenny”
“We move fast and need talent yesterday, but we also want every hire to feel special.”
Jenny is the sole HR lead at a fast-growing startup. She values streamlined hiring and employee experience but lacks the time or resources to coordinate onboarding gifts or services. ReFlexHire allows her to hire efficiently and impress new hires with zero extra workload.
  2. Corporate Recruiter – “David”
“We work with multiple agencies, but none offer post-hire support.”
David manages hiring across departments in a mid-sized enterprise. He’s used to paying standard placement fees, but ReFlexHire's onboarding credits help him justify the cost and win buy-in from team leaders who value a memorable welcome for new employees.
  3. Freelance Recruiter – “Soojin”
“I want to offer clients more than just resumes—it’s my brand too.”
Soojin is a seasoned independent recruiter. By using ReFlexHire, she can offer a unique value proposition: hiring support + onboarding experience bundled into one. It gives her a competitive edge in winning new clients.
- Key User Flows
  1. Client Company Hiring a Candidate via ReFlexHire
A company posts a role or submits a hiring request. ReFlexHire matches them with a qualified recruiter. Once a candidate is hired, instead of paying a traditional fee, the client pays a flat fee (e.g., 10%)—part of which is converted into onboarding service credits. The company selects an onboarding package from the ReFlexHire vendor marketplace, creating a seamless hiring-to-welcome experience.
  2. Recruiter Submitting a Candidate
A verified recruiter receives a job brief through ReFlexHire. They submit qualified candidates via the platform. If their candidate is hired, the recruiter earns their fee minus the value of onboarding services, which the company redeems through ReFlexHire. This motivates recruiters to offer not just talent but full-cycle hiring support.
  3. Client Browsing and Using Onboarding Services
After a successful hire, the client is prompted to redeem onboarding credits. They browse curated services—from welcome kits to celebratory treats to mobile onboarding events—and place an order directly through the platform. The fulfillment is handled by ReFlexHire's vendor partners, ensuring quality and convenience.
- UI/UX Considerations
  1. Simple and Trust-Building Interface
The platform must immediately convey trust and ease of use. Clear navigation, calm color schemes, and straightforward copywriting are essential to reduce friction, especially for HR managers who are not tech-savvy.
  2. Dual-Facing Design (Client & Recruiter)
The UI should support two primary user types:
  ① Clients (companies hiring)
  ② Recruiters (submitting candidates)
      Each user should have a tailored dashboard showing relevant actions—e.g., "Track Candidate," "Select Onboarding Package," or    "Submit New Job."
  3. Onboarding Credit Visualization
After a successful hire, clients should clearly see their available onboarding credits and the catalog of services they can redeem. A clean, e-commerce-like redemption experience (filters, categories, checkout) will ensure conversion.
  4. Mobile Accessibility
Many recruiters and HRs work remotely or on-the-go. A responsive design optimized for mobile and tablet ensures broad usability without degrading experience.
  5. Status Tracking and Transparency
Real-time updates on hiring status, credit redemption, and delivery logistics (for onboarding kits or services) help create transparency and accountability—crucial for B2B trust.
  6. Delightful Micro-Interactions
Small UI touches—like animations on successful submissions or personalized welcome messages—can elevate the user experience, especially in onboarding moments.
  7. Multi-Language & Localization Ready
As ReFlexHire plans to expand globally, the UI must be built with multi-language support in mind, allowing for localization of content, currency, and service offerings.]

Secure strategic vendor partnerships (onboarding goods/services)

What’s Not in the MVP
Full ATS functionality or public job board
Advanced candidate search filters
Multi-language support
Automation of all vendor workflows (initially handled manually)

- Future enhancements
As ReFlexHire evolves beyond its initial MVP stage, the platform will introduce a series of strategic enhancements to broaden functionality, strengthen the ecosystem, and increase monetization opportunities.

1. Advanced ATS Integration & Workflow Automation
To support larger enterprise clients and professional recruiters, ReFlexHire will incorporate deeper integration with applicant tracking systems (ATS) such as Greenhouse, Lever, and Workable. This includes:

6. Global Expansion Toolkit
Prepare for international adoption by launching:

Multilingual platform versions (Korean, English, Japanese, etc.)
Tax and compliance modules for onboarding services in other regions
Localization playbooks for key markets (e.g., onboarding culture in Japan vs. U.S.)

- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks
